# student-performance-analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student academic performance to identify key factors influencing test scores across math, reading, and writing.

## Dataset

- Filename: student.csv  
- Description: The dataset contains demographic and academic information for students, including gender, parental education, test preparation, and scores in math, reading, and writing.  
- Target metrics: Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score, Average Score

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

## Project Structure

student-performance-analysis  
- student.csv  
- student_performance_analysis.ipynb  
- README.md  
- requirements.txt  

## Analysis Performed

- Checked for missing values and column structure  
- Calculated total and average scores  
- Visualized score distributions  
- Compared performance by:
  - Gender  
  - Test preparation status  
  - Parental level of education  
- Correlation analysis between subjects  
- Pairwise relationships of subject scores  

## Key Insights

- Students who completed a **test preparation course** generally scored higher  
- **Female students** scored better in reading and writing; **males** led slightly in math  
- **Parental education level** is loosely associated with student performance  
- Scores in math, reading, and writing are **strongly correlated**

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Ensure `student.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook  
3. Open `student_performance_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
4. Run all cells in order
